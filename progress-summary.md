## Technical Implementation

### Patterns Used
- **Component Reusability**: Leveraged existing UI components from shadcn/ui
- **Consistent Styling**: Tailwind CSS with existing theme patterns
- **State Management**: React hooks following existing patterns
- **Mock Data**: Realistic healthcare data for all features

## Current Status

### Completion Metrics
- **Total Stories**: 66
- **Completed**: 25 (38%)
- **Remaining**: 41

### What Works
- ✅ Full navigation structure
- ✅ All main pages created
- ✅ Mock data flows
- ✅ Basic interactions (drag & drop, form submissions)
- ✅ Responsive layouts

### What's Missing
- ❌ Real video integration (Zoom SDK)
- ❌ Live transcription
- ❌ Database persistence
- ❌ Authentication/authorization enforcement
- ❌ External integrations (calendar, billing APIs)
- ❌ Real-time updates
- ❌ Production security measures

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **TanStack Table Integration**: Enhance billing console with proper data table
2. **Calendar Integration**: Connect to Google Calendar/Outlook
3. **Security Audit**: HIPAA compliance checklist
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all PHI access

### Future Enhancements
1. **AI Integration**: Connect transcription to note generation
2. **Video Platform**: Zoom SDK implementation
3. **Medical Coding**: CPT/ICD-10 API integration
4. **Performance**: Lazy loading, code splitting
5. **Testing**: Unit tests, E2E tests

## Demo Flow

1. **Login** → Land on Today view
2. **See Time Saved** → "1h 42m this week" animation
3. **Start Session** → Click session card (currently routes to placeholder)
4. **Review Draft** → Navigate to Drafts, click a note
5. **Edit & Submit** → Make changes, validate, submit with success
6. **Supervisor Review** → Drag cards through workflow, view diff
7. **Check Billing** → Review claims with confidence scores
8. **View Analytics** → See performance metrics

## Technical Debt

- Mock data should be replaced with API calls
- Placeholder pages need full implementation
- TypeScript types could be more strict
- Some components could be further decomposed
- Need error boundaries for production

## Conclusion

The MVP demonstrates a complete UI shell for an AI-powered EHR system with:
- Professional healthcare-focused design
- Intuitive workflows for providers and supervisors
- Clear value proposition (time savings)
- Foundation for AI integration

The system is ready for:
- User testing and feedback
- Backend API development
- Integration work
- Security hardening
