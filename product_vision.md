Below is a “word-picture” of the ideal UI so you can see it clearly in your mind (and hand off to a designer or Next.js engineer tomorrow).

## 1. The Overall Shell

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Top Bar: quick-add │ global search │ profile │ status  │
├──────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Nav  │ Active Workspace (changes with each nav item)    │
│      │                                                   │
│      │                                                   │
│      │ Right-Side Context Drawer (slides in as needed)   │
└──────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

* **Left vertical nav** (60 px collapsed → 220 px on hover) keeps every role one click from mission-critical areas.
* **Top bar** carries transient actions—“Start Session,” universal search, connection status (Zoom, calendar, clearinghouse).
* **Right context drawer** appears only when extra info helps: live transcript, patient timeline, code rationales, comment threads.
* Desktop first, but the grid collapses gracefully to a bottom-tab mobile layout.

## 2. Navigation Anatomy (with selling language baked in)

| Icon | Label             | Purpose & Selling Point                                              |
| ---- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏠   | **Today**         | Zero-friction agenda. One-tap “Start Session” launches AI Scribe.    |
| 📅   | **Calendar**      | Google/Outlook feed + color-coded session types; drag to reschedule. |
| 🎙️  | **Live Sessions** | Ongoing streams; shows “Listening ▸ Drafting ▸ Ready.”               |
| 📝   | **Drafts**        | Inbox of AI-generated notes waiting for 2-minute review.             |
| ✔️   | **Supervisor**    | Kanban co-sign board; audit trail wins compliance teams.             |
| 💵   | **Billing**       | Spreadsheet-style claim queue with confidence badges.                |
| 📊   | **Analytics**     | 4DX scoreboards: lead/lag metrics, clinician time saved.             |
| ⚙️   | **Settings**      | Templates, integrations, role permissions.                           |

*(Swap labels for icons only in collapsed state; tooltips appear on hover.)*

## 3. Key Screens Up Close

### A. **Today View** — “Launchpad”

* Hero banner: *“You’re saving 1 h 42 m this week.”* (social proof every login)
* List of sessions in chronological order; each card shows patient photo, service type, location icon (🏢 / 💻).
* Primary button on each card: **Start Session**. Starting:

  * Opens Zoom/Meets/Teams link **and** brings the AI Scribe bot.
  * Displays a subtle recording indicator + “AI Listening” badge.

### B. **Live Session Overlay**

* Occupies right 25 % of screen so faces stay visible.
* Live transcript auto-scrolls; important utterances pulse softly.
* Two contextual chips pop when confidence > 90 %:

  * *“Ask about current meds?”*
  * *“Document risk-factor X.”*
* Mic mute, flag significant moment, end session.

### C. **Draft Review Workspace**

```
┌──────────────┬────────────────────────────┐
│ Transcript    │ AI-Generated Note          │
│ (scroll)      │ (editable blocks)          │
│               │ [Accept Code]  [Reject]    │
└──────────────┴────────────────────────────┘
```

* Side-by-side panes; edits propagate live word-count & compliance checks (character minimum, time thresholds).
* Sticky footer: **Submit for Co-Sign** in one click.

### D. **Supervisor Board**

Kanban with swim-lanes *Waiting → Reviewing → Signed*.

* Hover surfaces diff-view of clinician edits, risk tags.
* Quick-approve, or “Clarify” opens threaded chat that pings clinician.

### E. **Billing Console**

* Familiar spreadsheet (TanStack Table) with frozen header row.
* Each row: CPT suggested, ICD-10 suggested, modifiers, fee.
* Badge colors: green = ready, amber = needs human look, red = missing info.
* Right drawer shows transcript snippet that justified every code.

## 4. Micro-Interactions & Visual Tone

| Element        | Intentional Feel                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Color palette  | Calm “clinic blue” + optimistic teal accents (trust + innovation).           |
| Motion         | 150 ms slide/scale for drawers; skeleton loaders so nothing “jumps.”         |
| Empty states   | Friendly AI avatar (“I’ll listen in on your next session—nothing here yet”). |
| Success toasts | Checklist animation when note → signed → claim queued.                       |

---

## 5. Calendar Integration Details

* **Full-screen Calendar** under 📅 nav inherits native GCal colors so users instantly trust it.
* Creating an event inside the app auto-adds Zoom link + flags it as “AI capture.”
* Hover event → preview shows last note, outstanding tasks.
* Drag-drop rescheduling writes back via OAuth to Google/Outlook.

---

## 6. “Demo Day” Storyboard (what prospects will see)

1. **Login → Today View**: countdown toast *“2 h 15 m clinician time saved this month.”*
2. Click **Start Mock Session** → overlay shows live transcription & smart prompt popping up.
3. End call; Draft Review loads in < 30 sec. Accept note > Submit.
4. Switch role to Supervisor; board shows card flashing “New.” Approve.
5. Jump to Billing Console; first-pass acceptance = 100 %.
6. Close with Analytics: burndown chart of clinician time spent on notes now trending toward zero.

The prospect walks away thinking, *“My team will literally finish work on time and my cashflow will speed up.”*

### Why this UI sells

* **Familiar SaaS skeleton** means no training friction.
* **Opinionated workflows** slash clicks—your core differentiator.
* **Immediate metrics** turn the 4DX “scoreboard” into a built-in marketing proof point.

Give this outline to a UI/UX designer and a Next.js front-ender and you’ll have clickable Figma prototypes within a week—strong enough to close pilots while the backend catches up.
