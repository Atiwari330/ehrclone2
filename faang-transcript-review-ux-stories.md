## Notes for AI Agent Builder

### Before Starting
1. Read this entire document first
2. Complete Epic 1 (Foundation & Analysis) before any coding
3. Check off completed tasks using [x] in this file
4. Create checkpoint summary files as specified
5. Pay special attention to existing patterns in the codebase

### Key Patterns to Follow
- **Component Structure**: Use existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- **API Routes**: Follow Next.js App Router patterns from existing routes
- **State Management**: Use React hooks and existing context patterns
- **Error Handling**: Use ChatSDKError pattern for consistency
- **AI Integration**: Follow existing AI service patterns from `lib/ai/`
- **Performance**: Follow existing optimization patterns for large data sets

### Logging Requirements & Best Practices
1. **Always include console.log statements for**:
   - AI pipeline execution start/completion with timing
   - User interactions with AI insights and action completion
   - Progressive loading state changes and result updates
   - Error conditions with full context and recovery attempts
   - Performance metrics for transcript rendering and highlighting
   - Accessibility and keyboard interaction events
   - Analytics events and user behavior tracking

2. **Logging Format Standards**:
   - Use descriptive prefixes: `[AIInsights]`, `[Transcript]`, `[Pipeline]`, `[Performance]`
   - Include timestamps for AI pipeline coordination and timing metrics
   - Log object structures with JSON.stringify for complex AI results
   - Use console.warn for performance degradation or accessibility issues
   - Use console.error for AI pipeline failures and critical UX problems

3. **Complex Feature Logging Strategy**:
   - Break down AI pipeline coordination into numbered log statements
   - Log progressive loading state transitions and user experience metrics
   - Include performance markers for operations > 200ms (FAANG standards)
   - Log user interaction patterns for UX optimization insights

### When Stuck
1. Review existing transcript review page implementation
2. Check the AI pipeline API endpoints for integration patterns
3. Look at existing component patterns in the UI components directory
4. Create a simplified version first, then enhance with FAANG-level features
5. Document blockers in checkpoint files

### Progress Tracking
- Update this file with [x] for completed tasks
- Create checkpoint files at specified milestones
- Include completion percentage in checkpoint files
- Note any deviations from original plan
- Track actual vs estimated time for FAANG-level features
