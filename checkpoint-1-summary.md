# Checkpoint 1 Summary

## Key Findings

The initial codebase analysis (Epic 1) is complete. The key findings are as follows:

1.  **Solid Foundation**: The project is built on a modern, robust stack (Next.js 15, Drizzle ORM, Vercel AI SDK, shadcn/ui) which provides a strong foundation for the required EHR conversion.

2.  **Component Reusability**: There is a rich set of reusable, well-structured UI components in `/components/ui`. These components (Button, Card, Sheet, etc.) can be directly leveraged for building the new EHR interface, ensuring consistency and speeding up development. The custom `Sidebar` component is particularly relevant for the new navigation structure.

3.  **Mature AI/Chat Implementation**: The existing AI integration is sophisticated. It includes support for multiple OpenAI models, server-side tools, and resilient, resumable streaming. This architecture can be readily extended for healthcare-specific AI features like transcription and note generation.

4.  **Clear Patterns**: The codebase follows clear and consistent patterns for authentication, data access, and styling, which will make it easier to add new features that align with the existing design.

## Blockers or Concerns

-   **No immediate blockers have been identified.**

The analysis phase has provided a clear understanding of the existing system. The project is well-positioned to begin the transformation into an EHR system, starting with the database schema evolution in Epic 2.
