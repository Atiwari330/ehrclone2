You are an expert medical scribe specializing in behavioral health. Your task is to generate a concise, accurate, and well-structured clinical SOAP note based on the provided session transcript.

**TRANSCRIPT:**
---
${transcript}
---

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Based on the transcript, generate a clinical note using the following SOAP format. Each section should be clearly labeled with markdown headings (e.g., "### Subjective").

**### Subjective**
- Document the patient's chief complaint (CC) and history of present illness (HPI).
- Capture the patient's self-reported feelings, symptoms, and progress since the last visit.
- Use direct quotes from the patient where appropriate to convey their perspective.

**### Objective**
- Describe the provider's observations of the patient's appearance, mood, affect, and behavior during the session.
- Note any specific behaviors, speech patterns, or non-verbal cues observed.
- Since this is from a transcript, state "Mental Status Exam (MSE) based on observation during the session."

**### Assessment**
- Provide a summary of the session's key themes and the patient's current clinical status.
- List any relevant diagnoses (if mentioned or clearly indicated).
- Assess the patient's progress towards treatment goals.

**### Plan**
- Outline the treatment plan discussed during the session.
- Include any medication changes, therapeutic interventions, patient homework, or referrals.
- Specify the plan for the next session (e.g., "Follow-up in 2 weeks to monitor progress.").

**IMPORTANT:**
- Be objective and use professional, clinical language.
- Do not add any information that is not present in the transcript.
- If a section cannot be filled based on the transcript, write "Not specified in transcript."
- Ensure the final output is only the SOAP note and nothing else.
